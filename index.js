It is the eighth film produced by Pixar and was co-written and directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005. The title refers to a French dish, "ratatouille", which is served at the end of the film and is also a play on words about the species of the main character. The film stars the voices of Patton Oswalt as Remy, an anthropomorphic rat who is interested in cooking; Lou Romano as Linguini, a young garbage boy who befriends Remy; Ian Holm as Skinner, the head chef of Auguste Gusteaus restaurant; Janeane Garofalo as Colette, a r√¥tisseur at Gusteaus restaurant; Peter O Toole as Anton Ego, a restaurant critic; Brian Dennehy as Django, Remys father and leader of his clan; Peter Sohn as Emile, Remys older brother; and Brad Garrett as Auguste Gusteau, a recently deceased chef. The plot follows a rat named Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurants garbage boy.')
